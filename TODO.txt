## Things to change in stimuliclass.py

# general (for all classes)
- there is a long pause after eyeone calibration or before stimuli start
  --> try to get rid of it

# CRTTest
- winType="pygame" does not show on eizoGS320
- prompt for starting measurement is missing

# SinGrating
- prompt for starting measurement is missing
- change frequency of sine curve (right now only amplitude can be changed)
  --> I think that's why it's not working 

# PatchBrightnessTest
- There should only be one patch when using eizo


## Try out all classes and functions and look for bugs (and stuff that is
## not useful in general)

## What is the correct header? Under which license is the TUB code
released? How to write this into the header?

# Probably affected files:
- stimuli.py
- stimuliclass.py
- mondrian.py
- articulated.py
