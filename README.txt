stimuli
=======

Repository of scripts for porting stimuli to psychopy. This code is based
on TUBvision (https://github.com/TUBvision/TUBvision).

You can find an original version of this repository at
https://github.com/jamesmcm/StimScripts. James wrote these scripts as part
of an internship for our colorlab
(http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/psychologie/meth/colorlab/). We took over
maintaining it after he left, so what you find here is probably the most
recent version.

Documentation for this package can be found in the folder doc.
